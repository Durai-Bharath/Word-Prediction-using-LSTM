# Word Prediction using LSTM

## ðŸ“– Description
The **Word Prediction using LSTM** project unleashes the power of modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques, combining **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **N-Gram** methods to enable text generation. The project demonstrates how these techniques are utilized in large language models (LLMs) for accurate and coherent word predictions.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Document Training**: Train the model with a text document to learn patterns and sequences.
- **Word Prediction**: Generate the next word(s) in a sequence based on the trained data.
- **Modern NLP Techniques**: Implements LSTM and N-Gram algorithms for high-quality predictions.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - TensorFlow

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Details
1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
   - A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of learning long-term dependencies.
   - Ideal for sequential data like text, enabling the model to predict coherent words.
2. **N-Gram Technique**:
   - A probabilistic model that predicts the next word in a sequence based on the preceding \( n-1 \) words.
   - Complements LSTM by incorporating statistical properties of language.
